# CommandCentre
An extendable Python script which will feature functionality for interacting with my dev environment via mobile.
This script features a custom plugin system for extending functionality. Look at the existing plugins for help on how to create these.

Author: Charlie Cook

Current commands are:

- Exit
- Echo (Text goes here)
- Sound alert
- Vagrant up
- Vagrant halt

NOTE: To run this, you must have an account with the Pushbullet service, 
take your account token from the settings and create a Python file named APIToken.py, 
which contains the token in a variable named "token".
